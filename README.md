This is my portfolio submission for misc workshop of web dev.
I first made an html file which had all the written content to be shown on the web page. this file also has different tags like div and button which are defined in css and js files respectively. I also added functional links to my github, email, linkedin accounts so that people can connect with me for any kind of queries.

then i created a css file which had the codes to alter the font-color, background color, border properties, the dimensions of various tags(header, paragraph, div, button) used in the html file etc. to amke my web page look presentable and beautiful.

lastly i created a js file which basically defined the action to be performed by different button tags defiend in html file, these buttons make the web page look responsive to the user.
